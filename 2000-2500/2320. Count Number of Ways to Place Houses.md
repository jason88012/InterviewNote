# [2320. Count Number of Ways to Place Houses](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-ways-to-place-houses/)

There is a street with n * 2 plots, where there are n plots on each side of the street. The plots on each side are numbered from 1 to n. On each plot, a house can be placed.

Return the number of ways houses can be placed such that no two houses are adjacent to each other on the same side of the street. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that if a house is placed on the ith plot on one side of the street, a house can also be placed on the ith plot on the other side of the street.

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Possible arrangements:
1. All plots are empty.
2. A house is placed on one side of the street.
3. A house is placed on the other side of the street.
4. Two houses are placed, one on each side of the street.
```

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 9

## 1d - DP
首先我們可以發現，其實我們只需要求單邊有幾種組合，然後最後答案再給他平方就好，再來要思考的方向實際上是: 當用house結尾或是用space結尾時有幾種方法?
如果我們前面有蓋房子，這一格只能留空格，反之如果前面是空格，這一格就可以選擇蓋或不蓋。所以程式其實很簡單:

```cpp
int countHousePlacements(int n){
    const int kMod = 1e9 + 7;
    unit64_t house = 1, space = 1, total = house + space;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        // If we want put house here,
        // last must be space
        house = space;
        // We can put space here anyway
        space = total;
        total = (house + space) % kMod; 
    }
    return (total * total) % kMod;
}
```
