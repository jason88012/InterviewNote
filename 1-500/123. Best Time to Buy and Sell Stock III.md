# [123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

問買賣股票最多可以賺多少錢，這次最多可以做兩次買賣操作，第二次的買進必須在第一次賣出之後

## DP
假設我們只能做一次買賣，那就跟`121.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock`是一樣的，做法是紀錄先前遇過最低的價格作為買入價，收益就是現在遇到的價格去減之前最低的買進價格。當我們要做第二次交易的時候要怎麼想呢? 假設我們在第一次的交易賺到了100元，那當我們在第二次買進的時候，假設是200，但這時我們就好像只花了100去做第二次買進，所以第二次的買價其實是基於第一次的收益去計算的，故我們一樣只需要: 最小化兩次買價以及最大化兩次收益即可。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy1 = INT_MAX, profit1 = 0;
        int buy2 = INT_MAX, profit2 = 0;
        for (int p: prices) {
            buy1 = min(buy1, p);
            profit1 = max(profit1, p - buy1);
            buy2 = min(buy2, p - profit1);
            profit2 = max(profit2, p - buy2);
        }
        return profit2;
    }
};
```
