# [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)

Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:

The path starts with a single slash '/'.
Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')
Return the simplified canonical path.

```
Example 1:

Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
Example 2:

Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
Example 3:

Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

把給定的字串轉換為有效的路徑

## stringstream
這題其實主要是在考string分割的處理，其實想法很簡單，就是用一個`vector`作為stack使用，每當遇到`".."`就把最後記錄進去的路徑pop掉，另外要記得處理空字串和`"."`的情況(要忽略)，最後再用`ostringstream`把`vector`裡面的字串拼起來就好了。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        vector<string> stack;
        char delimeter = '/';
        istringstream iss(path);
        string buf;
        while (getline(iss, buf, delimeter)) {
            if (buf == "" || buf == ".") {
                continue;
            } else if (buf == "..") {
                if (!stack.empty()) {
                    stack.pop_back();
                }
            } else {
                stack.push_back(buf);
            }
        }
        if (stack.empty())
            return "/";
        ostringstream oss;
        for (string path: stack) {
            oss << "/" << path;
        }
        return oss.str();
    }
};
```
