# [1845. Seat Reservation Manager](https://leetcode.com/problems/seat-reservation-manager/)

Design a system that manages the reservation state of n seats that are numbered from 1 to n.

Implement the SeatManager class:

SeatManager(int n) Initializes a SeatManager object that will manage n seats numbered from 1 to n. All seats are initially available.
int reserve() Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
void unreserve(int seatNumber) Unreserves the seat with the given seatNumber.

```
Input
["SeatManager", "reserve", "reserve", "unreserve", "reserve", "reserve", "reserve", "reserve", "unreserve"]
[[5], [], [], [2], [], [], [], [], [5]]
Output
[null, 1, 2, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null]

Explanation
SeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); // Initializes a SeatManager with 5 seats.
seatManager.reserve();    // All seats are available, so return the lowest numbered seat, which is 1.
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
seatManager.unreserve(2); // Unreserve seat 2, so now the available seats are [2,3,4,5].
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 3.
seatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 4.
seatManager.reserve();    // The only available seat is seat 5, so return 5.
seatManager.unreserve(5); // Unreserve seat 5, so now the available seats are [5].
```

設計一個class有`reserve()`和`unreserve()`兩個功能，`reserve()`可以預訂一個當前最小且空著的座位，`unreserve()`會取消一個已經預訂過的座位(保證取消的座位必定已經被預訂過)。

## priority_queue
與其去紀錄已經被預訂下的座位，我們可以反過來紀錄已被取消的座位，由於題目保證`unreserve`的座位必定是已經被預訂過的，這代表`unreserve`的參數必定會在當前最新的座位之前(假設從1開始)，所以每次有新的預訂進來時，我們可以先確定有沒有之前取消過所留下的空位，再決定要不要開新的座位出去，而為了保證我們每次都可以取到號碼最小的空位，使用priority_queue儲存被取消過的座位。

```cpp
class SeatManager {
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> canceled;
    int curr = 1;

public:
    SeatManager(int n) {}                        

    int reserve() {
        if (canceled.empty()) {
            return curr++;
        }
        int res = canceled.top();
        canceled.pop();
        return res;
    }
    
    void unreserve(int seatNumber) {
        canceled.push(seatNumber);
    }
};
```
