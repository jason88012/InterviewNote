# [2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/fair-distribution-of-cookies/)

You are given an integer array cookies, where cookies[i] denotes the number of cookies in the ith bag. You are also given an integer k that denotes the number of children to distribute all the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.

The unfairness of a distribution is defined as the maximum total cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.

Return the minimum unfairness of all distributions.

```
Input: cookies = [8,15,10,20,8], k = 2
Output: 31
Explanation: One optimal distribution is [8,15,8] and [10,20]
- The 1st child receives [8,15,8] which has a total of 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 cookies.
- The 2nd child receives [10,20] which has a total of 10 + 20 = 30 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(31,30) = 31.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 31.
```

```
Input: cookies = [6,1,3,2,2,4,1,2], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal distribution is [6,1], [3,2,2], and [4,1,2]
- The 1st child receives [6,1] which has a total of 6 + 1 = 7 cookies.
- The 2nd child receives [3,2,2] which has a total of 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 cookies.
- The 3rd child receives [4,1,2] which has a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(7,7,7) = 7.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 7.
```

```
2 <= cookies.length <= 8
1 <= cookies[i] <= 10^5
2 <= k <= cookies.length
```

## Binary Search (???)
第一眼看到又是一個分配的問題，馬上就想到了:
- [875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)
- [1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)
但實際上這題要求的是`subset`，而上面兩題要求的是sub array，所以在檢查binary search的condition時並不會比較快，雖然其實可以用Binary search，但並沒有比較快

## Backtracking
比賽的時候沒有注意到這題的限制:`2 <= k <= cookies.length <= 8`，既然這麼低直接Backtracking暴力解就可以了，每個餅乾都可以決定要分給哪個小孩，當所有餅乾都分配完了之後再來檢查當前的unfairness是多少即可。

```cpp
    int distributeCookies(vector<int>& cookies, int k) {
        vector<int> kids(k, 0);
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        solve(0, cookies, kids, ans);
        return ans;
    }

    void solve(int curr, vector<int>& cookies, vector<int>& kids, int& ans) {
        // If the last cookies has been distributed
        // Check current unfairness
        if (curr == cookies.size()) {
            int unfairness = INT_MIN;
            for (int d: kids) {
                unfairness = max(unfairness, d);
            }
            ans = min(ans, unfairness);
            return;
        }

        // Distribute cookies[curr] to kids[i].
        for (int i = 0; i < kids.size(); ++i) {
            kids[i] += cookies[curr];
            solve(curr + 1, cookies, kids, ans);
            kids[i] -= cookies[curr];
        }
    }
```

```
Runtime: 1217 ms, faster than 50.00% of C++ online submissions for Fair Distribution of Cookies.
Memory Usage: 6.7 MB, less than 100.00% of C++ online submissions for Fair Distribution of Cookies.
```

backtracking的的時間複雜度雖然是`O(k^n)`，但是由於這題的`k`跟`n`最多就是8，所以最多就是`O(8^8)`
