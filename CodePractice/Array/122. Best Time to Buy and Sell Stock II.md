# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

## Question
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
``` 
We can do infinite transactions!

## 解法1: Greedy
由於我們可以做無限次數的交易，最簡單的方法就是把每次大於0的價差都加起來 (這就是有未來視買股票的作弊能力)

```cpp
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            int diff = prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            profit += diff > 0 ? diff : 0;
        }
        return profit;
    }
```
