# [218. The Skyline Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/)

A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]:

lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
heighti is the height of the ith building.
You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.

The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]

```
Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
Explanation:
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.

參考網站上的圖比較清楚，題目給定一些建築的左側，右側和高度，問這個圖形的剪影轉折點有哪些

## map + multimap
題目要找的是轉折點的位置和高度，所以我們很明顯我們要對於每個轉折的地方(不論是變高還是變低)進行標記，標記該點的位置和高度，最好要按照位置排序好，那麼自然而然得可以想到使用`map`，其中key代表了位置，val代表高低，但我們又要區分這是建築的起始位置還是結束位置，這邊我們可以用正負號來區分。

排序好後接下來我們就要檢查每個位置的狀況，在題目給的圖片中我們發現當有多個建築重疊時，我們只需要取最高的那個，而當建築寬度結束後我們就取次高的。所以這邊我們又可以想到使用可以排序的結構來快速存取最高的那個建築高度，並且又要有辦法在離開該建築後把他清除掉，由於我們要有辦法移除寬度結束後的建築，再加上有可能會有多個相同高度建築重疊，所以這裡我們可以使用`multiset`，就同時滿足了上面的所有需求。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> getSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& buildings) {
        // sort building heights with position,
        // there might have different height in same position.
        map<int, vector<int>> m;
        for (auto& b: buildings) {
            m[b[0]].push_back(b[2]);  // start
            m[b[1]].push_back(-b[2]); // end, mark as negative
        }

        // check each edge, use the heighest as the skyline
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        multiset<int> pq;
        for (auto& [pos, hs]: m) {
            for (int h: hs) {
                if (h > 0) {
                    // get new building height
                    pq.insert(h);
                } else {
                    // the building height out of scope
                    pq.erase(pq.find(-h));
                }
            }

            int curr = pq.size() ? *pq.rbegin() : 0;
            // If the skyline is same as previous,
            // no need to add it to answer.
            if (res.size() && res.back().back() == curr)
                continue;
            res.push_back({pos, curr});
        }
        return res;
    }
};
