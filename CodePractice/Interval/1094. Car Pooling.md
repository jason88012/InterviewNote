# [1094. Car Pooling](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/)

There is a car with `capacity` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where `trips[i] = [numPassengersi, fromi, toi]` indicates that the `ith` trip has `numPassengersi` passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are fromi and toi respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return true if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or false otherwise.

```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false
```

```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
```

簡單說就是給一台空車有`capacity`個座位，依據`trip`給的情況`[乘客, 起點, 終點]`檢查是否有辦法完成所有旅程

## Find max overlap counts - Tree map
這題其實就是找出最多有幾個人同時在車上(最多重疊)，並且這個最多重疊人數必須要小於題目給的`capacity`。那一樣我們針對上車與下車的地方做增減，然後再依照地點順序檢查是否超標即可，一樣使用tree map就可以順便對地點做排序了

```cpp
    bool carPooling(vector<vector<int>>& trips, int capacity) {
        // pos: passenger
        map<int, int> road;
        for (auto& trip: trips) {
            road[trip[1]] += trip[0];
            road[trip[2]] -= trip[0];
        }
        int passenger = 0;
        for (auto& pos: road) {
            passenger += pos.second;
            if (passenger > capacity) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
